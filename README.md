## Check Me Out

Hi! My name is Michele. I'm an avid rock climber, a videographer & photographer, and a travel enthusiast. From a young age, I've been facinated with capturing my life through a lens! From vlog-style videos, cooking tutorials, short film projects, and climbing content to street photography, travel shots, food photos, and candids of friends/family, I am there to memorialize it all.
